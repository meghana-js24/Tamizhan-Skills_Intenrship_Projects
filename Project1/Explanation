The table i got after building and training the Linear Regression Model 
This table is the clean, processed data we fed to our model.
Date: The calendar date.
Sales: The sum of all sales for that entire day. For example, on January 1st, 2019, the total revenue was $4745.18.
Days: This is the simple number our model uses instead of the date. Day 0 is our starting point. Day 1 is the next day, and so on. 
The model learns the relationship between this number and the Total.

The Graph (Actual vs. Predicted Trend)

This graph tells the story of your model's performance.
Blue Dots (Actual Sales): Each blue dot represents the actual total sales for a specific day. Notice how they are scattered all over the placeâ€”some days sales are high (like the dot near $6000), and other days they are low (like the dot near $2000). This shows that your daily sales have high variability.
Red Line (Predicted Sales Trend Line): This is your Linear Regression model. A linear model can only draw a single straight line that it thinks "best fits" the data.
The Problem: Your data points don't follow a straight line, so the model struggles. It draws a line that cuts through the middle of the dots.
The Trend: The red line is slightly tilted downwards. This means your model concluded that, on average, there is a very slight decreasing trend in sales over this period.

The Conclusion: The most important takeaway is that a simple Linear Regression model is not a good fit for this specific dataset. The actual sales jump up and down far too much for a simple straight line to be an accurate predictor. This is a fantastic finding! In a real-world scenario, this tells you that you need a more advanced forecasting model to capture these complex patterns.
